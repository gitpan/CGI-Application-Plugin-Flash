CGI-Application-Plugin-Flash

This CGI::Application plugin implements a Flash object.  A flash is session
data with a specified life cycle.  When you put something into the flash it
stays then until the end of the next request.  This allows you to use it for
storing messages that can be accessed after a redirect, but then are
automatically cleaned up.
